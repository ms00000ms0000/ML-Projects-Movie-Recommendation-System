# ML-Projects-Movie-Recommendation-System
This **Machine Learning project** is a **Movie Recommendation System** that suggests similar movies based on user input. The system utilizes **TF-IDF Vectorizer** for text feature extraction and **cosine similarity** to measure similarity between movies. Key features such as **Genres, Keywords, Tagline, Cast, and Director** are combined to create a meaningful representation of each movie. Using **difflib**, the system matches the user’s input with titles from the dataset and retrieves movies with the highest similarity scores. This project demonstrates how **content-based recommendation systems** work, providing **personalized movie suggestions** through **NLP and similarity-based algorithms** for an engaging user experience.
